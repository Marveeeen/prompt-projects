# Prompt-Driven Feature Lab — HTML, CSS & JavaScript

Welcome to my **Prompt-Driven Feature Lab**, a personal project where I build standalone, fully functional web features using only **HTML**, **CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript** — guided and refined through **prompt engineering techniques**.

## Purpose

This repository serves two main goals:

1. **Sharpening prompt engineering skills**  
   I explore and test prompt structures, variations, and best practices to generate more useful, accurate, and creative responses from AI tools — focusing on problem solving through code.

2. **Reinforcing frontend fundamentals**  
   Each feature is coded from scratch without libraries or frameworks, pushing me to think deeply about:
   - Semantic HTML structure
   - WCAG-compliant accessibility
   - Responsive styling
   - DOM logic and user interaction
