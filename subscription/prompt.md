Your task is to create HTML and CSS files for a stylish form offering 15% off to new subscribers. The product is called Majestic, a monthly subscription for a store that sells necklace for couples

Please follow the steps below:

- Create a heading for the product name and offer.
- Add a short paragraph describing the product and the benefits of subscribing.
- Build a registration form with a required email input field and a “Get My 15% Off” button.
